## Adding these Custom Commands
I assume you know how to create a custom command. This repository is separated into groups / categories. Most categories have standalone custom commands, meaning you can add one, two, or even all of them without issues.
There are some "systems" which require you to add *all* commands. This is detailed in the individual `README.md` of that section.

When you find a custom command you wish to add, the file will have a leading comment explaining what it does and the recommended trigger type & trigger. You can add it in the YAGPDB dashboard with these attributes.

## Contributing
If you spot an error, feel free to make a PR or open an issue. I'll get to it ASAP.
If you wish to add your own command, feel free to make a PR as well. I'm open to all suggestions.

*If you are adding a new CC, please read the [guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)*.

## Disclaimer
This repository and myself are not officially affiliated with YAGPDB in any shape or form. The YAGPDB creator and staff are not responsible for any difficulties caused by these custom commands.
These commands are not guaranteed to be working. I strive to test all the custom commands here, but due to many reasons sometimes I am unable to.
